# Model tier test

Held-out synthetic program ciphers, difficulty `medium`, 3 cases per length, seed 0. Swarm arms: 5 rounds x 8 proposals, at most 20000 attempts per case. Runtime 94s.

Recovered = an attempt surviving the final check (Bonferroni over all of the arm's attempts on that case) decrypts to >= 90% of the plaintext. Each arm has its own ledger.

Model spend is logged in `reports/model_spend.sqlite` (kept across runs, so per-model `max_usd` caps are cumulative).
